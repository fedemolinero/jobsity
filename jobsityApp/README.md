This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Run live server

After build the browser app, a live server is needed to run.
You can easily start the app by writing in the console in the same folder that where you build the app
`live-server ./dist/jobsity-app/`

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
